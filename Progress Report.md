# Project-Tweety
Project Tweety is an arduino based tweeting interface project, it will take humidity and temperature values as 
input and for any major change in these values, it will trigger a tweet post.

## Resources Used:
  * Arduino Uno R3
  * Ethernet Sheid W5100
  * DHT22 Humidity & Temperature Sensor
  * Arduino IDE (for Arduino programming)

## Libraries Used:
  * Tweeter API Library
  * DHT11 Lib (Also used for DHT22)

## Progress Report:

  ###DATE: 28-08-2015
  
  Study for the project feasibility complete, all required intel gathered and distributed in working team.
  DHT22 sensor recieved and properly tested on Arduino Uno R3. 
  No extra connections required as the sensor can be directly adjusted on the Arduino digital ports itself.
  Waiting for the Ethernet Sheild for further progress on ethernet connection verification.
  creating the twitter account is on hold, waiting for the resource gathering to complete.
